## 📊 **Project Overview**

Telecom companies lose millions due to customer churn. This end-to-end
project predicts which customers are most likely to leave, combining:

-   **SQL** → Data extraction, cleaning, transformation\
-   **Power BI** → Interactive churn analysis dashboard\
-   **Machine Learning** → Predictive churn model

The goal is to help businesses identify churn drivers and take action to
improve customer retention.

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

  Component          Tools Used
  ------------------ ----------------------------------------
  Data Cleaning      SQL
  Visualization      Power BI
  Machine Learning   Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost)
  Notebook           Jupyter
  Plotting           Matplotlib, Seaborn
  Deployment         GitHub

## 🗂️ **Dataset**

Telecom Customer Churn dataset includes demographics, services used,
billing details, and churn label (Yes/No).

## 🔧 **Workflow**

### **1️⃣ Data Preparation (SQL)**

Performed data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering.

### **2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis**

Analyzed churn drivers and customer behavior.

### **3️⃣ Power BI Dashboard**

Includes churn summary, demographics, billing insights, and service
patterns.

### **4️⃣ Machine Learning Model**

Tested multiple models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost,
SVM.

Example model scores (replace with your own):

  Metric      Score
  ----------- ---------
  Accuracy    **82%**
  Precision   **79%**
  Recall      **74%**
  F1 Score    **76%**

## 🧠 **Key Insights**

-   High monthly charges strongly correlate with churn\
-   Month-to-month contract users churn the most\
-   Long-tenure customers rarely churn\
-   Lack of tech support increases churn probability

## 🏆 **Business Recommendations**

-   Offer discounts for high-billing customers\
-   Promote annual/long-term plans\
-   Improve tech support accessibility\
-   Improve fiber optic service quality
